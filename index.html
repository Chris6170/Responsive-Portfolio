                Hello everyone my name is Christopher, no one really calls me that unless your my mom screaming my name
                because
                I forgot to do the dishes or defrost the chicken.If you struggle to recognize who I am, just look to
                the
                corner of the classroom.....Yeah that guy! There really isn't much to me, I spend my time in the gym or
                in
                the kitchen trying to come up new ways to make a bowl of spinach sound remotely attractive. I love to
                dance,
                blast music (all types except for country,sorry), hit the lanes and watch movies. I have moved around
                quite
                a bit, went from only visiting for a couple of week to almost being here for almost a year. Hopefully
                you'll
                get to know me a lot more these next couple of months while we all suffer together and achieve whatever
                goal
                we came here with
